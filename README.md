Hermes
======

**In time-honored Runnable tradition**:  
Hermes is second youngest of the Olympian gods. Hermes is a god of transitions
and boundaries. He is quick and cunning, and moves freely between the worlds 
of the mortal and divine, as emissary and **messenger** of the gods,[1] intercessor 
between mortals and the divine, and conductor of souls into the afterlife. 
He is protector and patron of travelers, herdsmen, thieves,[2] orators and wit, 
literature and poets, athletics and sports, invention and trade.[3] In some 
myths he is a trickster, and outwits other gods for his own satisfaction or 
the sake of humankind. His attributes and symbols include the herma, the 
rooster and the tortoise, purse or pouch, winged sandals, winged cap, and his 
main symbol is the herald's staff, the Greek kerykeion or Latin caduceus which 
consisted of two snakes wrapped around a winged staff.[4]
